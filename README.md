# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice** repository!  
This folder contains a wide range of JavaScript examples and exercises that I've practiced — from beginner to intermediate concepts.

## Folder Overview

This repository includes organized files and code snippets covering:

### Core Concepts
- **Functions** – All types: regular, anonymous, arrow functions, IIFE, etc.
- **Loops** – `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, `for...in`
- **Conditional Statements** – `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`

### Data Types & Operations
- **Arrays** – Basic and advanced operations: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.
- **Objects** – Properties, methods, destructuring, nested access
- **Math Functions** – `Math.min`, `Math.max`, rounding, random numbers
- **Type Checking** – `typeof`, `instanceof`, and other checks

### Working with Dates
- Creating, formatting, and manipulating JavaScript `Date` objects

### ES5 vs ES6 Features
- `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, spread/rest, destructuring, classes, promises, etc.

### Form Validation
- Basic HTML form validations using JavaScript (e.g., empty fields, email format, password length)

### Practical Solutions
- Finding minimum and maximum numbers
- Extracting the middle element of an array
- Custom logic examples and common challenges

## Purpose

This repository helps me:
- Solidify my understanding of core JS
- Track my learning journey
- Revisit solutions and best practices
- Share knowledge with others

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore each file — no setup needed. Just open in any browser or use a code editor like VS Code.
